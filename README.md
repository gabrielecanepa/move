**MOVE** is an `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript` and `jQuery` powered web template.

It was realized as a free project after completing all the introduction courses on the popular education website   [![Codecademy](img/codecademy.png)](https://www.codecademy.com/)

The project was mainly inspired by the courses [Learn JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-javascript) and [jQuery](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/jquery).
