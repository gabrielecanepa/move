**MOVE** is an `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript` and `jQuery` powered web template.

It was realized as a sample project after completing all the introduction courses on the popular education website <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-blog/assets/logo_blue_dark.png" height="20" alt="Codecademy" title="Codecademy"/></a>

The project was mainly inspired by the courses [Learn JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-javascript) and [jQuery](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/jquery).
