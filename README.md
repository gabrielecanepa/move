This sample web page has never been used for lucrative purposes and outside Codecademy's environment, and is only available at [Github's author personal page](https://www.github.com/gabrielecanepa) and [Codecademy's profile](https://www.codecademy.com/gabrielecanepa).

**MOVE** is an `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript` and `jQuery` powered web template.

It was realized after completing all the introduction courses on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-blog/assets/logo_blue_dark.png" height="20" alt="Codecademy" title="Codecademy"/></a>

The project was mainly inspired by the course [Learn JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-javascript).
